"""
peer/tools.py — tool proxy logic: filter and call MCP tools on behalf of peers.

The trust boundary between robots. Access is decided by two things:

  1. `role` — what class of tool this peer may reach at all:
       * `viewer`   — read-only: `sensor`/`resource` from any layer, plus the whole
                      **perception** layer (ASR, TTS synthesis, OCR, VOP compute on
                      data and publish to a topic; they move nothing)
       * `operator` — the above **and** tools that act: `actuator`, the whole
                      **actucore** layer (the execution layer — its `vla` and
                      navigation tools drive the robot despite declaring
                      `processor`), and `controller`
       * `blocked`  — nothing
  2. `tool_filter` — a comma-separated glob list narrowing further within the role,
     e.g. `camera_*,battery`. A bare `*` means "everything the role allows".
     Patterns are matched against **both** the full `mcp__<id>__<tool>` name and the
     bare tool name, because `camera_*` is what a human writes and it would
     otherwise match nothing at all — silently granting less than intended.

**What `operator` means, stated plainly:** an operator peer can drive this robot's
actuators through `/api/peer/tools/call` with no local LLM in the path and no human
confirmation. What still constrains it: the pairing had to be confirmed by a human
on both screens, the role was chosen by a human, the tool must be wired to the
decision core on *this* machine's canvas (api/peer.py, gate 2), `tool_filter` can
narrow it per tool, and every call now announces itself on the activity stream.
Granting `operator` is therefore a real decision, not a formality; `viewer` is the
default for a newly paired peer for that reason.

An undeclared `type` counts as acting — a trust boundary should fail closed, and a
driver that declares nothing is exactly where a guess would be worst.

Two earlier versions of this rule were wrong in ways worth recording, because both
looked reasonable:

* **Guessing the class from the tool name.** It tested for `move`, `grasp`,
  `speak`, `set_`, `execute`, `control` in the name — and a real robot's actuators
  are called `loco`, `led`, `speaker`, `switch_mode`, none of which match. So a
  *viewer* peer could drive locomotion. The declared type from the driver's
  metadata is used instead.
* **Trusting the declared type alone.** `type` does not separate "computes on data"
  from "moves hardware": actucore documents `vla` as a `processor`, and a VLA policy
  drives the robot; navigation's `goto` has the same shape. The layer has to be part
  of the judgement, which is why `category` (sent at registration: `perception`,
  `actucore`, `driver`) is read alongside it.

Hence the rule above: a bare `*` can never grant motion, and granting more is an
explicit act by the local operator, per peer, per tool. Whatever is granted here is
still subject to the receiver's canvas gate — the canvas says what may be reached
at all, this file says what a given peer may ask for.
