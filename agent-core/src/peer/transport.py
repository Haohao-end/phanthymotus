"""
peer/transport.py — authenticated peer-to-peer requests.

## Why not mTLS

The design called for pinned mTLS, and that is the cleaner primitive — but it
cannot be used here. The Agent Core serves **one** port, 15678, to both the
browser dashboard and to peers. Turning on client-certificate verification
there would demand a certificate from every browser and lock the operator out
of their own robot. Splitting peers onto a second port would mean a second
TLS listener and a new firewall rule on every deployment, which the "no new
port" property in the README exists to avoid.

So the link is the existing HTTPS, and authentication is per-request Ed25519
signatures over `method | path | ts | nonce | sha256(body)`. That yields the
properties that actually mattered:

  * the peer's key is **pinned** — the signature is checked against the key
    recorded at pairing time (peer/store.public_key_bytes), never against a key
    the request supplies, so a self-signed TLS cert on either end changes nothing;
  * replay is bounded by a timestamp window plus a nonce cache;
  * it survives links that are not TLS at all, which is what the BLE bootstrap
    path in the design will need.

TLS still does its job of encrypting the channel. It is simply not what
establishes who is on the other end.

## Clock skew

The timestamp window is the one part that depends on the environment: offline
robots have no NTP and drift. `peer_settings.clock_skew_s` widens it. The nonce
cache is what actually stops replay, so widening the window degrades gracefully
rather than opening a hole — a replay inside the window still fails on the nonce.
