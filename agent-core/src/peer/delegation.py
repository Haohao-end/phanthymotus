"""
peer/delegation.py — task delegation logic: spawn subagents on behalf of peers.

A peer can delegate a task by sending a SubagentSpec. This agent spawns it
locally, streams progress, and returns the result. The delegated spec's
tool_filter is intersected with what the peer's role allows — a viewer peer
delegating a task cannot magically gain operator tools through the delegation.

hop_count prevents infinite chains: A → B → C → D is capped at 2 hops.
