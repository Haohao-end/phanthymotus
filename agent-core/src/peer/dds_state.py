"""
peer/dds_state.py — share the local ROS2 topic list with paired peers.

What is shared is DDS state; **how** it travels is signed HTTPS, not DDS.

This module used to publish the local topic list on a ROS topic and subscribe to
every peer's equivalent. Two things ended that:

1. **DDS is now locked to loopback** (`deploy/dds-local.xml`), because one
   robot's `/remote_control/message` was reaching every robot on the LAN — a
   command bus with no authentication and no addressing. Cross-machine DDS is
   physically cut, so the subscriptions could never deliver anything again.
2. **Transport isolation in FastDDS is process-wide.** Measured on real
   hardware: a profile cannot let one participant stay local while another
   talks to the network, so "keep the internal bus local but give peers their
   own DDS domain" is not implementable, whatever the domain layout.

Moving to `transport.post_json` is not a workaround; it is what the data always
needed. The peer bus had no authentication, so any process on the same
ROS_DOMAIN_ID could forge another robot's topic list. Now every push carries an
Ed25519 signature and is accepted only from a paired peer.

Still **state only, never commands** — the rule outlives the transport change.

Optional throughout: with no ROS2 bridge running there are no local topics to
share, and this quietly does nothing. It is a visibility feature, and the
topology view degrades to empty rather than the app failing to start.
