"""
peer/registry.py — the merged view of who is out there.

Providers each report sightings; this collapses them by `peer_id`. That merge is
the whole reason discovery is keyed on a public-key fingerprint: the same robot
seen over mDNS on the LAN and over a cloud roster from another site is *one*
peer with *two* links, so when the LAN drops the other link is already known and
no re-pairing is needed.

Kept separate from peer/store.py on purpose. This is "seen recently", which is
volatile and untrusted; the store is "paired with", which is durable and
trusted. Conflating them would make an advert able to change a peer's role.
