"""
api/peer.py — peer discovery, pairing and messaging endpoints.

## Two sides

**Dashboard → this Agent Core** — authenticated with ACCESS_TOKEN per auth.py,
exactly like every other dashboard-facing endpoint. These tell the operator what
peers are out there, kick off pairing, list paired peers, and mutate their roles.

**Peer Agent Core → this Agent Core** — authenticated with Ed25519 signatures
per peer/transport.py. The pairing handshake is the only request type that comes
from an unpaired peer, so it runs `verify_signed_request(require_paired=False)`
and relies on the human comparing a short code. Everything else requires the
peer be in the `peers` table, and the signature is checked against the key we
recorded at pairing time — that pin is what makes trust durable.

The `/api/peer/inbox/*` paths are exempt from `auth.py` middleware because they
carry their own authentication. See the rule in auth.py and the CRITICAL comment
in start.py's router ordering.
