/**
 * topic-derive.js — resolve canvas cards' derived output topics from the driver.
 *
 * A multiInstance tool's output topic is *derived*: the driver infers it from the
 * input topic the card is connected to (`/remote_control/mic` + asr →
 * `/remote_control/mic/asr`). Nothing in the saved layout can be relied on to
 * hold it — the canvas page asks for it as a side effect of being open, so a
 * card's topic reaching the layout depends on someone having visited that page.
 * The monitor dashboard builds its panels from those topics, which is why the ASR
 * panel "isn't there from the start".
 *
 * `action: info` is a read, so asking is cheap and safe. Kept free of DOM and
 * renderer imports so it can be tested directly:
 *   node --test "agent-core/web/js/*.test.mjs"
