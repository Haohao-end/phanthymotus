# Deploy Approval Agent — Stateless Alignment

An independent FastAPI service (the *Deploy Controller*) that manages the
deployment lifecycle of PRs across `4paradigm/phanthymotus` and
`4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver`. It does **not** build, review, or mutate code;
it only orchestrates the deploy approval process through GitHub PR comments.

## Architecture

```
Developer → GitHub PR
Machine Owner → GitHub PR
GitHub PR → Review Agent
GitHub PR → Deploy Controller
Deploy Controller → Agent Core
Deploy Controller → COS
```

- **Only persistence is the GitHub lifecycle comment hidden state.**
- No SQLite, no DeploymentStore, no DB_PATH, no persistence beyond GitHub.
- **GitHubCommandWatcher** polls PR comments using `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` from the upstream environment. Default: 30 seconds.
- **GitHubStateProxy** reads/writes hidden state JSON in the lifecycle comment.
- **DeployController** is stateless between commands — it reads state from the lifecycle comment, validates, and writes back.

## Backward Compatibility

Deploy Approval maintains **full backward compatibility with v1 hidden state**. Existing lifecycle comments with the `<!-- deploy-approval-state:v1
... -->` marker are read and written without requiring any new fields. Legacy visible markdown is preserved until the first meaningful lifecycle event, at which point it is archived to an immutable History Archive before the new renderer takes over. Deployments and restarts do NOT automatically rewrite legacy comments.

## State Machine (hidden state only)

```
review-required → reviewing → deploy-ready → deploy-requested → testing → succeeded | failed
Crash interruption: status remains deploy-requested, command.phase becomes uncertain; the next poll re-reads fresh hidden state but does NOT replay — only a new `/approve_deploy` can resume
```

**Removed states:** `waiting-approval`, `waiting-machine-clean`, `deploying`, `deploy-failed`, `test-failed`, `rejected`, `cancelled`, `expired`, `rolling_back`, `rolled_back`, `rollback_failed`, `waiting_cleanup`.

**Multi-machine partial coverage:** `/approve_deploy` operates only on the compatible subset of REMAINING (undeployed) components for the selected machine. Multiple machines can independently approve and deploy their respective compatible subsets across multiple `/approve_deploy` calls. Once ALL components are deployed the lifecycle advances to `testing`. If any machine experiences post-deploy uncertainty the lifecycle stays `deploy-requested` with `command.phase=uncertain`. Previously durably successful components are never re-deployed.

## Commands

| Command | Actor | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/request_deploy` | PR Author | Request deployment for current HEAD. Binds the latest complete current-HEAD Review Agent GitHub comment evidence and ALL deployable components. |
| `/approve_deploy machine=<alias-or-ip>` | Machine Owner or write/maintain/admin collaborator | Approve the compatible undeployed subset on one machine. A literal IPv4 must resolve uniquely; the canonical alias is persisted. |
| `/record_test result=pass|fail [summary="..."]` | Machine Owner or write/maintain/admin collaborator | Record overall test result. No machine parameter. |
| `/deploy_status` | Anyone | Read-only deployment status from hidden state. |
| `/deploy_help [topic]` | Anyone | Help for commands. |

**Legacy commands that are now `unknown`:** `/reject_deploy`, `/rollback_deploy`, `/cancel_deploy`, `/resume_deploy`.

## Stale Command Handling

Stale commands (e.g. duplicate `/approve_deploy` after lifecycle has advanced to `testing`, or duplicate `/record_test` after `succeeded`) are **silent NO-OPs**: the cursor advances, zero GitHub error comment is created, zero lifecycle mutation occurs, zero History is appended, zero labels are mutated, and zero deploy POST is executed. The watcher logs `STALE_COMMAND_IGNORED`.

Commands that are "not ready" (e.g. `/approve_deploy` while status is `reviewing`) produce a `### Deploy Approval — Command not ready` informational comment; this is NOT a deployment error.

## Key Contracts

- **Stateless:** No SQLite, no DB_PATH, no DeploymentStore. All state is in the GitHub lifecycle comment hidden state.
- **GitHub hidden lifecycle JSON is the ONLY authoritative persistent Deploy Approval business-state store.** Fresh facts come from trusted Review Agent GitHub comments and Agent Core
and are copied into hidden state to make the snapshot restart-safe.
- **Restart-safe, single-replica / single-writer:** Deploy Approval is intentionally restart-safe stateless, but only one `GitHubCommandWatcher` serially processes mutating commands. Multiple concurrent Deploy Controller replicas are unsupported because the current hidden-state protocol has no CAS/distributed lock, and replicas >1 would violate the at-most-once unsafe-side-effect model.
- **Polling:** PR comments are polled using `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` from the upstream environment. Default: 30 seconds. No webhook required.
- **Open-PR watcher enumeration:** `GitHubCommandWatcher` enumerates all open PRs in configured `GITHUB_REPOS`. Enumeration uses `state=open`, `sort=updated`, `direction=desc`, `per_page=100` and continues paging until the batch is empty or shorter than 100. There is no age/lookback cutoff, no 500-PR truncation, and page overlap is deduplicated by PR number. Closed/merged PRs are not enumerated by Deploy Approval.
- **POLL_ENABLED must be true.** Webhook is supplementary only.
- **Hidden state JSON:** The lifecycle comment carries a `<!-- deploy-approval-state:v1\n{...}\n-->` marker with validated JSON state.
- **Trusted identity:** The lifecycle comment author must match the configured GitHub App identity. Deploy Approval uses lazy GitHub App provenance (`performed_via_github_app.id` == configured `GITHUB_APP_ID`) validated at comment patch time. No startup bot-identity lookup. No `/apps/{slug}/bot` calls.
- **Top-level status labels:** only `review-required`, `reviewing`, `deploy-ready`, `deploy-requested`, `testing`, `succeeded`, `failed`.
- **Status labels:** `status:*` labels are best-effort UI projection only. Label bootstrap/list/create failures are logged as warnings and never block startup or business operations. Label failure does not affect any gate or lifecycle transition.
- **Review Agent authentication:** Review Agent uses a user-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`, not the GitHub App. This is strictly separate from Deploy Approval's GitHub App credentials.
- **Supported repos (DESIRED_REPOS):** `4paradigm/phanthymotus` and `4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver` are permanently declared as desired/supported repositories in source code.  Runtime `GITHUB_REPOS` is resolved at startup by a single fresh `GET /installation/repositories` call: `ACTIVE_REPOS = DESIRED_REPOS ∩ AUTHORIZED_REPOS`.  Missing, duplicate, unknown, or third-party repository entries fail closed.
- **Evidence source:** `/request_deploy` performs an exact current-HEAD Review Agent comment evidence lookup from GitHub PR Conversation. Trusted Review Agent GitHub comments provide Build Result, Test Results, and Code Review. Build/Test commit short SHA resolves via GitHub to full SHA for exact equality with fresh PR HEAD. Image tag comes from the selected Build Result comment Images section (full mutable ref, not basename). Deploy Approval freezes the exact image:tag from the trusted Review Agent GitHub comment. Deploy Approval performs zero Registry HTTP. Agent Core receives the exact tag and owns all Registry authentication, pull, and deploy. No Review Agent HTTP API.
- **Source matrix:** GitHub PR comments are the source of Review Agent Build/Test/Code Review evidence and image:tag candidate facts; Deploy Approval freezes the exact image:tag from the trusted Review Agent comment without contacting the Registry; Agent Core receives the exact tag and owns all Registry authentication, pull, and deploy; GitHub persists the deployment snapshot. Legacy repo@sha256 hidden-state values remain readable only for migration and historical compatibility.
- **Deployability:** `phanthymotus` deploys `core`, `perception` and `actucore`; `phanthymotus-driver` deploys exact driver paths.
- **Core self-update contract:** `core` deployment uses Agent Core POST `/api/system/update` with exact image ref to trigger asynchronous self-restart. Deploy Approval polls GET `/api/system/update-check` and waits until `current_tag` (string) matches the target tag parsed from image ref. `up_to_date=True` is NOT sufficient for success. Core has no automated Case; runtime_id is fixed to `"core"`.
- **Variant contract:** perception variants are canonical `5.11` and `6.1`. Legacy `jetson-jp5.11` / `jetson-jp6.1` are normalized only at config load.
- **Runtime preflight evidence:** `/approve_deploy` reads `running_image` for the selected machine's compatible components. Non-empty `running_image` is recorded as evidence and does not block deployment; Agent Core owns replacement of an existing runtime. Controller does not perform stop/remove/cleanup.
- **Agent Core no-container response:** the current compatibility shape normalizes to `running_image=""` only when `running_image` and `error` are absent, `status` key exists, and `logs` is a string. The `status` value has zero preflight/health/case business influence. Error or malformed shapes fail closed.
- status value has zero preflight/health/case business influence.
- error/malformed shapes fail closed.
- **unsafe deploy POST:** if the POST outcome is unknown after the unsafe attempt begins, the command becomes `command.phase=uncertain`, `status=deploy-requested`, `approve_attempt.outcome=uncertain`, and there is ZERO later POST. Only a NEW `/approve_deploy` can resume, which re-checks fresh HEAD, fresh hidden state, fresh actor, fresh GitHub PR comments, and fresh runtime evidence.
- **Final unsafe order:** select the compatible undeployed subset -> collect runtime preflight evidence -> revalidate the exact approval comment and actor -> final fresh non-draft PR/full HEAD -> persist `command.phase=executing` to GitHub FIRST -> Agent Core deploy POST.
- **approval_revoked:** final fresh approval comment revalidation checks: comment object valid, comment id exact, actor id exact, body parses as approve_deploy, machine alias exact. If any check fails (comment deleted, changed, malformed, actor mismatch, machine alias mismatch, or cannot be revalidated): `approve_attempt.outcome=approval_revoked`, `status=deploy-requested`, `command.phase=completed`, cursor advances to current comment, ZERO deploy POST. Machine Owner must send a NEW `/approve_deploy`. `approval_revoked` is not a top-level status and does not introduce a new lifecycle state.
- **Partial progress:** zero coverage performs ZERO deploy POST and requires a NEW approval for a compatible machine. A successful partial subset is persisted and remains `deploy-requested`; only after every component is durably deployed does status advance to `testing`.
- **Post-deploy verification:** non-core components require `status=running` and exact target image. Core uses update-check/update and exact non-empty `current_tag == target_tag`; core is deployed last.
- **Draft hard gate:** `/request_deploy`, `/approve_deploy`, and the final fresh validation before an unsafe POST all require an open, unmerged, non-draft PR.
- **Evidence lookup:** `/request_deploy` performs an exact current-HEAD Review Agent comment evidence lookup from GitHub PR Conversation.
- **PR Author only:** Only the GitHub PR author can run `/request_deploy`.
- **Authorization:** `/approve_deploy` requires the actor to be the selected machine owner OR a write/maintain/admin repo collaborator. `/record_test` requires the actor to be an owner of any actually deployed machine OR a write/maintain/admin repo collaborator. Self-approval is allowed when the actor satisfies one of the above authorization conditions (e.g. PR author is also a machine owner). Numeric GitHub user ID is checked against fresh PR author ID at approval gates only for collaborator permission resolution, not as an additional self-approval gate.
- **Exact HEAD required:** GitHub HEAD is re-checked at each decision point; drift supersedes the deployment.
- **Open-PR watcher boundary:** If an enumerated PR is merged or closed before command execution or before an unsafe deploy POST, the existing fresh PR gates reject it and Deploy Approval performs zero deploy POST. Post-merge release deployment is outside Deploy Approval.
- **No rollback/reject/cancel/resume:** These commands are not supported.
- **COS evidence:** Uploads a single gzip-compressed evidence.log.gz to private COS. Terminal evidence includes case result metadata and a one-shot snapshot of actual deployed runtime logs. GitHub persists only `object_key`, `sha256`, and `size`; secret values are redacted. A 120-second HTTPS presigned GET URL is generated and rendered in the GitHub terminal comment as a temporary bearer link. The URL is not persisted in hidden state. No public Deploy Approval download endpoint, GitHub user OAuth, or PKCE is used.
- **Evidence download:** Terminal comments render **Download COS evidence** as a link to a short-lived HTTPS presigned GET URL generated server-side from private COS credentials. The presigned URL expires after 120 seconds (2 minutes). Bucket remains private; the signed URL is temporary bearer access. The URL is not persisted in hidden state. No Deploy Approval public HTTPS endpoint is required for evidence. Only `object_key`, `sha256`, and `size` are stored in GitHub hidden state.

## Required GitHub App Permissions

Minimum repository permissions:

- **Pull requests: write** — used for PR reads and PR conversation comments /
  status-label operations.
- **Metadata: read** — needed for collaborator permission lookup.

Do **not** request Administration or Actions permission.

**Contents: read** — The current target repository
`4paradigm/phanthymotus` is PUBLIC, so `resolve_commit_sha()` (which calls
`GET /repos/{repo}/commits/{ref}`) operates without granting Contents: read.
The current minimum deployment permissions therefore do not need to be
broadened solely for this public rollout. If a future authorized target
repository is private, the commit endpoint requires GitHub App `Contents:
read`; permissions must be explicitly reviewed before private-repo
enablement.

## Review Agent Integration

Deploy Approval does **NOT** call any Review Agent HTTP API.
Deploy Approval does **NOT** need:
- Review Agent host / IP / port
- Review Agent `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Review Agent SSH / dashboard
- `host.docker.internal` connectivity

Deploy Approval reads Review Agent output exclusively from **GitHub PR conversation comments**
written by the trusted Review Agent operator.

### Comment Protocol

Review Agent writes comments using the fixed marker `<!-- pr-review-agent -->` with three sections:

1. **Build Result** — `## PR Review Agent — Build Result`
   - Contains commit short SHA, target build table, and image references.
2. **Test Results** — `## PR Review Agent — Test Results` (optional)
   - Contains test suite pass/fail counts.
3. **Code Review** — `## PR Review Agent — Code Review`
   - Contains the review text.

Deploy Approval parses these comments via `review_comment_parser.py` and extracts
`ReviewCommentEvidence` containing build_comment_id, builds, test/code review provenance.

### Trusted Comment Author

Deploy Approval validates that Review Agent comments come from a trusted author
configured in `secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
review_comment_trust:
  author_id: "7950763"
  author_login: "kentcyq"
```

**Authoritative production Review Agent GitHub identity:**

- GitHub user ID: `7950763`
- GitHub login: `kentcyq`

Configuration is read from `secrets.yaml` → `review_comment_trust`. It is **NOT**
an environment variable. Startup/deploy validation enforces an exact match; a
mismatch (for example `author_id=184792454` / `Haohao-end`) causes the process to
**fail closed** at startup.

- `author_id` must be exactly `"7950763"`.
- `author_login` must be exactly `"kentcyq"`.
- `performed_via_github_app` may be `null` (Review Agent uses a user PAT).
- Comments from any other author are **rejected (fail closed)**.

### Production Review Agent Singleton Invariant

**For production repos (`4paradigm/phanthymotus`, `4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver`):**

At most ONE authoritative Review Agent poller/producer may exist at any time.

Reasons:
- Review Agent poller watermark / processed comment IDs are instance-local state.
- Two Review Agent servers seeing the same `/request_bot_review` will duplicate jobs/comments/builds.
- No cross-instance distributed deduplication exists.

**Test Review Agent** must use:
- Must NEVER listen on production repos.

`AUTHORITATIVE_REVIEW_AGENT_COUNT_FOR_PRODUCTION_REPOS=1` is an operational go/no-go gate.

## Machine Owners Configuration

File: `deploy/deploy-approval/machines.example.yaml` (mount at `/run/deploy-approval/machines.yaml`)

```yaml
version: 1
machines:
  sh-g1-01:
    node_id: node-g1-01
    node_host: 192.0.2.101
    owners:
      - alice
      - bob
    targets:
      - perception
      - actucore
    platforms:
      - linux/arm64
    variants:
      - 5.11
      - 6.1
  sh-go2:
    node_id: node-go2
    node_host: 192.0.2.102
    owners:
      - bob
      - charlie
    targets:
      - driver
    driver_paths:
      - unitree/go2
    platforms:
      - linux/arm64
```

- `alias`: canonical machine identifier (top-level key under `machines`). The command accepts `/approve_deploy machine=<alias-or-ip>`; a literal IPv4 must resolve to exactly one machine and hidden state always persists the canonical alias.
- `node_id`: Deploy Approval machine-policy internal unique machine identifier
- `node_host`: fake example literal IPv4; real values live only in the local gitignored `deploy/deploy-approval/machines.yaml`
- `owners`: GitHub login list (case-insensitive, deduplicated)
- `targets`: explicit deployable targets for this machine
- `platforms`: canonical platform allowlist
- `variants`: canonical perception variants only (`5.11` / `6.1`)
- `driver_paths`: required for driver targets
- Missing/invalid file → startup fail closed
- Agent Core uses HTTPS to exact literal IPv4:15678. TLS certificate identity verification is disabled by the selected no-PEM deployment contract. Access is restricted by exact configured literal IP, fixed port, HTTPS, and per-machine Bearer token.
- Do not place real machine IPs, passwords, tokens, or certificates in docs, examples, tests, or source code.

## Repository Authorization Model

`DESIRED_REPOS` (permanently declared in source code):

- `4paradigm/phanthymotus` — **required**.  If not present in the fresh
  installation-repository list, startup **fails closed** and the watcher
  does not start.
- `4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver` — **optional / desired**.  If the current
  GitHub App installation is not authorized for the driver repository, the
  agent starts normally without the driver path; this is an informational
  condition, not a startup failure.

Startup resolves `ACTIVE_REPOS = DESIRED_REPOS ∩ AUTHORIZED_REPOS` via a
fresh `GET /installation/repositories` call at process startup.

**Authorization hot-reload (no restart required):** The Watcher periodically
(every 120 seconds, using monotonic clock) forces a fresh installation token
refresh via `GitHubAppAuth.refresh_installation_token()`, then re-fetches
`GET /installation/repositories` with the new token.  The complete paginated
repository list is validated; if the Driver repository becomes authorized, it
is added to `ACTIVE_REPOS` and enters a **pending-baseline** gate where all
its open PRs are baselined (cursor = max observed comment ID) before any
command dispatch resumes.  If the Driver repository is revoked, it is
removed at the next successful auth refresh cycle (up to ~120s) from `ACTIVE_REPOS`.  Auth recovery (invalid → valid)
also triggers a full Driver re-baseline to prevent replay of commands posted
during the authorization outage.

Review Agent evidence is sourced exclusively from trusted GitHub PR
conversation comments.  Deploy Approval does **not** access:

* Review Agent HTTP API
* Review Agent server
* Review Agent `GITHUB_TOKEN`

**Registry has been removed:** Deploy Approval performs zero Registry HTTP.
Trusted Review Agent exact image:tag is frozen into hidden state and passed
unchanged to Agent Core.  Agent Core owns all Registry authentication, pull,
and deployment.

## Lifecycle Workflow

The lifecycle comment displays a fixed 8-step workflow:

1. Request Review
2. Review Agent completed
3. Request deployment
4. Machine Owner approval(s)
5. All required components deployed
6. Automated Cases
7. Record validation result
8. Deployment accepted

Steps are marked `[x]` (complete) or `[ ]` (pending) with `← Next` on the first pending step.

## History & Archives

History is persisted in the visible lifecycle markdown, newest-first. When the visible body approaches 48 KiB, oldest events are moved to immutable **History Archive** comments (marked `<!-- deploy-approval-history:<repo>:<pr>:<page -->`). The main lifecycle comment links to archives. History is NEVER silently dropped. Hidden state JSON never contains unbounded history arrays.

## Fixed COS Layout

COS evidence uses a fixed root path `phanthymotus_pr/` (no runtime override). Layout:

```
phanthymotus_pr/
  phanthymotus/
    YYYY-MM/
      YYYY-MM-DD/
        pr-N/
          evidence-<sha>.log.gz
```

Same pattern for `phanthymotus-driver/`.

## Zero Registry Dependency

Deploy Approval performs **zero Registry HTTP**. It does not read, parse, or push to any container registry. Registry credentials, digests, and authentication are entirely owned by Agent Core. Deploy Approval freezes the exact image tag from the trusted Review Agent GitHub comment and passes it unchanged.

Deploy Approval does not define a new runtime env namespace.

It reuses the upstream existing keys below and fixed read-only files:

| Runtime input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | upstream existing env |
| `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` | upstream existing env |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` | upstream existing env (absolute path) |
| `GITHUB_REPOS` | upstream existing env |
| `POLL_ENABLED` | upstream existing env |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | upstream existing env |
| `WEBHOOK_ENABLED` | upstream existing env |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | upstream existing env |

| `machines.yaml` | fixed read-only machine policy file |
| `secrets.yaml` | fixed read-only COS secrets file |

## Private Key Operational Contract

- Private key must never be inline in source or documentation.
- Runtime takes `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` (absolute path).
- `deploy.sh` enforces local private ownership/mode.
- If a private key is exposed, rotate it before runtime validation.
- Never print the key.
