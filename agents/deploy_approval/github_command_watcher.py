"""GitHub command watcher — polls PR comments using `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

This is the ONLY active poller for Deploy Approval. It polls configured
repositories/open PRs, reads comments, identifies commands newer than the
hidden-state cursor, and dispatches them one at a time to the Deploy Controller.

No SQLite, no Redis, no local cursor file, no comment lease, no DB persistence.
Single serial worker — no asyncio.gather for mutating PR work.

Safety rules:
- Never write stale local hidden state over Controller output.
- Cursor-only mutation must fresh-read hidden state from GitHub and preserve
  exact visible markdown.
- After dispatching one valid command, stop processing that PR for this cycle.
- Next cycle starts with fresh GitHub state.
- Transient command failure -> no cursor advance and no later command processing
  in same PR cycle.
