"""Worker — runs the review pipeline for one job, with timeout and retry.

Retry policy: a job that exceeds `job_timeout_seconds` is presumed lost and
retried, as are infrastructure failures (network, git, registry). Conditions
caused by the PR itself are terminal and reported immediately — a merge
conflict or a genuinely broken build is the answer, not something to retry.

Job state is written through to the store at each transition, so the dashboard
survives a restart and shows in-flight work as it happens.
