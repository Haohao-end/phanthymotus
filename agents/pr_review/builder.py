"""Builder — shells out to the repos' existing build scripts.

Build output is streamed to a file on disk as it is produced, rather than
buffered in memory until the process exits. That is what makes the dashboard's
live log tailing possible, and it means a build that hangs or is killed still
leaves behind everything it printed up to that point — which is exactly what is
needed to diagnose it.

      build prints buildx progress, compiler lines, layer exports. A wedged one
      (network read, lock) prints nothing at all.
    - `timeout` — total wall clock, as a backstop for a build that prints
      forever without finishing.

    The wall clock alone used to be the only bound, and it killed a build that
    was compiling openfst one file at a time, output flowing the whole way —
    then reported it on the PR as a build failure. Slowness is not a hang.

    The subprocess is killed on both timeout and cancellation. Cancellation
    matters because the whole-job timeout cancels this coroutine from the

    orphaned, holding the build cache and CPU for the retry to contend with.
