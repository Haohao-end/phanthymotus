"""API endpoints for the dashboard.

Mounted under `/api` so the static file mount at `/` cannot shadow them, and to
match the project convention that all endpoints live under `/api/...`.

Responses are raw JSON rather than agent-core's `{code, message, data}`
envelope: `deploy.sh status` curls these directly and the README documents the
shapes, so the extra nesting would cost more than the consistency buys.
